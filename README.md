# ps4sdk ps4KernelDlSym Symbol Resolver

The ps4sdk ps4KernelDlSym Symbol Resolver is a windows forms application (requires .NET 4.0) which has developed to fit my needs for ps4 compiled payloads using Hitodamas open source ps4 sdk [Github](https://github.com/seb5594/ps4sdk).
This tool has been made to generate easily an offsettable to all symbols, where are getting called. In the current state, it is impossible to resolve stacked function calls. If i feel to, i will update this repo....
